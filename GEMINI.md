## Project Overview

PictoForge is a semantic SVG editor built with React and Vite. It's designed for inspecting, editing, and auditing SVG pictograms, particularly those generated by AI models. The editor provides a round-trip editing experience between a visual canvas and the underlying SVG code, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other.

The project uses a modern web technology stack:

*   **UI Framework:** React 19
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Testing:** Vitest
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **SVG Manipulation:** @svgdotjs/svg.js, react-moveable

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js 18+
*   pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Testing

To run tests:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test

# Run tests once
pnpm test:run

# Run tests with an interactive UI
pnpm test:ui

# Generate a test coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Production Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Development Conventions

### Coding Style

*   The project uses ESLint with the recommended JavaScript rules (`@eslint/js`), along with plugins for React hooks and React Refresh.
*   The ESLint configuration can be found in `eslint.config.js`.
*   Unused variables starting with an uppercase letter are ignored.

### Project Structure

*   The main application logic is in `src/`.
*   The main React component is `src/App.jsx`.
*   Reusable React components are located in `src/components/`.
*   Custom hooks are in `src/hooks/`.
*   Tests are co-located with the source code in `__tests__` directories or have a `.test.js(x)` extension.
*   The project uses a path alias `@` which points to the `src/` directory.

### Testing

*   The project uses Vitest for unit and integration testing.
*   The test environment is JSDOM.
*   Test setup is configured in `src/tests/setup.js`.
*   The Vitest configuration is in `vitest.config.js`.
